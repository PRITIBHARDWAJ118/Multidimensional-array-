# 2D Array or Matrix
## Aim :
To study and implement 2D arrays in C++.

## Theory: 

A 2D array in C++ is essentially an array of arrays, meaning it stores elements in a grid or table format with rows and columns. It is particularly useful when dealing with data that naturally fits into a two-dimensional structure, such as matrices, tables, or board games.

#### 1. Declaration and Initialization
A 2D array can be declared by specifying both the number of rows and columns.
Syntax: type arrayName[rows][columns];
Example: int arr[3][4]; // Declares a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns
         innt arr[3][4] = {
                           {1, 2, 3, 4},
                           {5, 6, 7, 8},
                           {9, 10, 11, 12}
                             };
#### 2. Accessing Elements
Elements in a 2D array are accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column.
example: int value = arr[1][2]; // Accesses the element at row 1, column 2.
